# Quadratic-Interpolation

The functionâ€™s critical value is bracketed, and a quadratic
interpolant is fitted to the arc contained in the interval. Then, the
interpolant is minimized, and the new interval is determined based on
the relation of the minimizer to the original endpoints of the interval.

In the code, you have to enter your function, which is needed to analyze. 
Also, three chosen points should be also set.
